SpecFlow is heavily influenced by Cucumber, which is a BDD tool for Ruby-based applications. However, due to trademark and licensing issues, TechTalk was not allowed to use the name "Cucumber" for their .NET-based BDD tool. As a result, they chose the name "SpecFlow" for their tool. Despite the different name, SpecFlow shares many similarities with Cucumber, including its use of Gherkin syntax for defining scenarios in a natural language format.

Automation is done with Steps (using StepDefinitions) reusable across multiple scenarios.
