In order for this to work, SpecFlow must convert the string parameter coming from the step to an instance of the datatype used in the binding method. In our case, this conversion is from a string to an int

SpecFlow provides out-of-the-box support for the conversion of most primitive datatypes
This even includes support for converting enum members to the proper type.

might be technically correct, you probably wouldn’t talk like this to another person. In human-to-human communication you would probably instead say something like

Given we have no items in stock.
Step argument transformations allow you to extend SpecFlow’s ability to convert strings in Gherkin steps to any type you wish. This means that we can go back to the very basic version of the step binding in our example, and inform SpecFlow of the desired conversion in a separate step transformation.

Instead of the conversion code being buried in the step binding or an extracted helper method, we now have the conversion separated into its own class.
By moving the conversion code to the implicit layer of SpecFlow magic, the binding is back on focusing on the business concern of the Gherkin step, i.e. wiring to the production code.

Using step argument transformations can bring a number of benefits, allowing you to write steps in a human-readable way that reflects the way you would express yourself in normal conversation. However, it is important to ensure that team members have at least a basic understanding of the “magic” going on behind the scenes.

It can be challenging for team members not familiar with the step argument transformations feature to understand how SpecFlow “magically” knows how to interpret a string such as “no” as 0. But this is generally an easy problem to solve.
